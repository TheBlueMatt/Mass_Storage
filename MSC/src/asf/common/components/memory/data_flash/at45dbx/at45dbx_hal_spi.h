 * \brief Connection of the AT45DBX DataFlash to SPI interface driver.
 *
 * This file manages the connection of the AT45dbx DataFlash driver to an
 * SPI service (could be spi master service or usart in spi mode). The SPI
 * service selection depends on  AT45DBX_USES_SPI_MASTER_SERVICE or
 * AT45DBX_USES_USART_SPI_SERVICE in conf_at45dbx.h
